# Project1

This Project is intended as test case development framework in cypress to practice writing tests in the sandbox for www.opencart.com
-It is intended as a basic dataloader with several assertions to verify text, radio buttons, drop down menus, submission and resubmission
-It follows the basic cypress development style to define test cases and assertions:
    it('login test', function() {
      Cy.get
    })
    
    
    
    
 Feel free to run the automation or add more tests
