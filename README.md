# Project1

This Project is intended as test case development framework with an automation suite sandbox written for www.sweetshop.com
--contains basic cypress tests for login, logout, and product search
--contains xvfb to run tests in headless mode
--contains a basic dataloader with several assertions to verify text, radio buttons, drop down menus, submission and resubmission
--contains a basic cypress development style to define test cases and assertions:
    it('login test', function() {
      Cy.get
    })
    
    
    
    
 Feel free to run the automation or add more tests
